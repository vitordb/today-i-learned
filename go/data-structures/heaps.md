A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value.

Heaps are specially good for implementing priority queues, taking out the values with the highest priority.

A heap is a data structure that can be expresses as complete tree (all the trees are full except for the lowest level)
