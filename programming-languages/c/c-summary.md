* C is a relatively "low level" language. C deals with the same sort of objects that most computer do, namely characters, numbers, and addresses.

* C provides no operations to deal directly with composite object such as character strings, sets, lists, or arrays. There are no operations that manipulate an entire array or string. The language does not define any storage allocation facility other than static definitions and the stack discipline proviced by the local variables of functions, there is no heap or garbage collection. 

* C itself provides no input/output facilities; there are no READ or WRITE statements, and no built-in file access methods. 

* C data types: int, float, char, short, long, double
