## Summary

A linked list represents a sequence of elements, or nodes, where each node contains both a data value and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence. This data structure doesn't demand contiguous memory allocation, offering flexibility in memory management as nodes can be dynamically allocated and linked together.

Unlike arrays, which require contiguous memory blocks, linked lists allow for more efficient memory utilization by dynamically allocating memory for each node as needed. This characteristic makes linked lists suitable for scenarios where the size of the data structure might change frequently or is unknown beforehand.

Linked lists manifest in various forms, each with its own characteristics and applications. Singularly linked lists connect each node to the next one in a unidirectional manner. Doubly linked lists extend this connectivity by linking each node not only to the next one but also to the previous one, facilitating traversal in both directions. Circular linked lists form a closed loop where the last node points back to the first, providing cyclic behavior and often used in scenarios like circular buffers or scheduling algorithms. These diverse variations make linked lists versatile and adaptable to different programming tasks and constraints.
