## Introduction

Hexagonal architecture revolves around key components:

Domain Model: This consists of the business logic at the core of the application.

Ports: These are adapters defining the I/O operations of our system. They serve as contracts for the adapters.

Adapters: These entities implement the defined ports, enabling interaction between our application and external system.

Layers: The organization of our application into separate layers each with a distinct responsability.
