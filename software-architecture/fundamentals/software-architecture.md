# Software Architecture

## Definition

Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.

## What is Software Architecture?

Software architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security, and manageability. It is the blueprint for both the system and the project developing it, consisting of the structure of components, their inter-relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.

## Software Architect

The software architect is responsible for making high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. The software architect is responsible for making decisions about the software architecture, the technology stack, the tools, and the frameworks that will be used to build the system. The software architect is also responsible for making sure that the software architecture is scalable, reliable, and secure.

- Transforms the business requirements into software solutions
- Orchestrates the technical decisions with the business requirements
- Deep understanding of the technology stack and the tools that are used to build the system, along with the concepts and arquitetural patterns
- Helps taking decisios in critical moments
- Reinforces good development practices

## Software Architecture vs Software Design

Software architecture is the process of defining a structured solution that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security, and manageability. Software design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component. It is the process of defining the software architecture, the technology stack, the tools, and the frameworks that will be used to build the system.
